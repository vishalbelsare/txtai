    An agent automatically creates workflows to answer multi-faceted user requests. Agents iteratively prompt and/or interface with tools to
    step through a process and ultimately come to an answer for a request.

    Agents excel at complex tasks where multiple tools and/or methods are required. They incorporate a level of randomness similar to different
    people working on the same task. When the request is simple and/or there is a rule-based process, other methods such as RAG and Workflows
    should be explored.
