However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowl-\\nedge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance\\nlags behind task-specific architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their\\ndecisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre-\\ntrained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric\\nmemory have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We\\nexplore a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation\\n(RAG) ‚Äî models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric mem-\\nory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric\\nmemory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense\\nvector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We com-\\npare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages\\nacross the whole generated sequence, and another which can use different passages\\nper token. We fine-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-\\nintensive NLP tasks and set the state of the art on three open domain QA tasks,\\noutperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract\\narchitectures.

In the following, we formally introduce both models and then describe the\\npŒ∑ and pŒ∏ components, as well as the training and decoding procedure.\\n\\n2.1 Models\\n\\nRAG-Sequence Model The RAG-Sequence model uses the same retrieved document to generate\\nthe complete sequence. Technically, it treats the retrieved document as a single latent variable that\\nis marginalized to get the seq2seq probability p(y|x) via a top-K approximation.

This allows the generator to choose content from several\\ndocuments when producing an answer. Concretely, the top K documents are retrieved using the\\nretriever, and then the generator produces a distribution for the next output token for each document,\\nbefore marginalizing, and repeating the process with the following output token, Formally, we define:\\n\\npRAG-Token(y|x) ‚âà\\nN‚àè\\ni\\n\\n‚àë\\nz‚ààtop-k(p(¬∑|x))\\n\\npŒ∑(z|x)pŒ∏(yi|x, z, y1:i‚àí1)\\n\\nFinally, we note that RAG can be used for sequence classification tasks by considering the target class\\nas a target sequence of length one, in which case RAG-Sequence and RAG-Token are equivalent.\\n\\n2.2 Retriever: DPR\\n\\nThe retrieval component pŒ∑(z|x) is based on DPR [26]. DPR follows a bi-encoder architecture:\\n\\npŒ∑(z|x) ‚àù exp\\n(\\nd(z)>q(x)\\n\\n)\\nd(z) = BERTd(z), q(x) = BERTq(x)'}\n",

We use\\na pre-trained bi-encoder from DPR to initialize our retriever and to build the document index. This\\nretriever was trained to retrieve documents which contain answers to TriviaQA [24] questions and\\nNatural Questions [29]. We refer to the document index as the non-parametric memory.\\n\\n2.3 Generator: BART\\n\\nThe generator component pŒ∏(yi|x, z, y1:i‚àí1) could be modelled using any encoder-decoder. We use\\nBART-large [32], a pre-trained seq2seq transformer [58] with 400M parameters. To combine the input\\nx with the retrieved content z when generating from BART, we simply concatenate them.

Instead, we run beam search for\\neach document z, scoring each hypothesis using pŒ∏(yi|x, z, y1:i‚àí1). This yields a set of hypotheses\\nY , some of which may not have appeared in the beams of all documents. To estimate the probability\\nof an hypothesis y we run an additional forward pass for each document z for which y does not\\nappear in the beam, multiply generator probability with pŒ∑(z|x) and then sum the probabilities across\\nbeams for the marginals. We refer to this decoding procedure as ‚ÄúThorough Decoding.‚Äù For longer\\noutput sequences, |Y | can become large, requiring many forward passes.

We use the document encoder to compute an\\nembedding for each document, and build a single MIPS index using FAISS [23] with a Hierarchical\\nNavigable Small World approximation for fast retrieval [37]. During training, we retrieve the top\\nk documents for each query. We consider k ‚àà {5, 10} for training and set k for test time using dev\\ndata. We now discuss experimental details for each task.\\n\\n3.1 Open-domain Question Answering\\n\\nOpen-domain question answering (QA) is an important real-world application and common testbed\\nfor knowledge-intensive tasks [20]. We treat questions and answers as input-output text pairs (x, y)\\nand train RAG by directly minimizing the negative log-likelihood of answers. We compare RAG to\\nthe popular extractive QA paradigm [5, 7, 31, 26], where answers are extracted spans from retrieved\\ndocuments, relying primarily on non-parametric knowledge. We also compare to ‚ÄúClosed-Book\\nQA‚Äù approaches [52], which, like RAG, generate answers, but which do not exploit retrieval, instead\\nrelying purely on parametric knowledge. We consider four popular open-domain QA datasets: Natural\\nQuestions (NQ) [29], TriviaQA (TQA) [24]. WebQuestions (WQ) [3] and CuratedTrec (CT) [2]. As\\nCT and WQ are small, we follow DPR [26] by initializing CT and WQ models with our NQ RAG\\nmodel. We use the same train/dev/test splits as prior work [31, 26] and report Exact Match (EM)\\nscores. For TQA, to compare with T5 [52], we also evaluate on the TQA Wiki test set.\\n\\n3.2 Abstractive Question Answering\\n\\nRAG models can go beyond simple extractive QA and answer questions with free-form, abstractive\\ntext generation. To test RAG‚Äôs natural language generation (NLG) in a knowledge-intensive setting,\\nwe use the MSMARCO NLG task v2.1 [43]. The task consists of questions, ten gold passages'}\n",

We do not use the supplied passages, only the questions and answers, to treat\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\nMSMARCO as an open-domain abstractive QA task. MSMARCO has some questions that cannot be\\nanswered in a way that matches the reference answer without access to the gold passages, such as\\n‚ÄúWhat is the weather in Volcano, CA?‚Äù so performance will be lower without using gold passages.\\nWe also note that some MSMARCO questions cannot be answered using Wikipedia alone. Here,\\nRAG can rely on parametric knowledge to generate reasonable responses.\\n\\n3.3 Jeopardy Question Generation\\n\\nTo evaluate RAG‚Äôs generation abilities in a non-QA setting, we study open-domain question gen-\\neration. Rather than use questions from standard open-domain QA tasks, which typically consist\\nof short, simple questions, we propose the more demanding task of generating Jeopardy questions.\\nJeopardy is an unusual format that consists of trying to guess an entity from a fact about that entity.\\nFor example, ‚ÄúThe World Cup‚Äù is the answer to the question ‚ÄúIn 1986 Mexico scored as the first\\ncountry to host this international sports competition twice.‚Äù As Jeopardy questions are precise,\\nfactual statements, generating Jeopardy questions conditioned on their answer entities constitutes a\\nchallenging knowledge-intensive generation task.\\n\\nWe use the splits from SearchQA [10], with 100K train, 14K dev, and 27K test examples. As\\nthis is a new task, we train a BART model for comparison. Following [67], we evaluate using the\\nSQuAD-tuned Q-BLEU-1 metric [42]. Q-BLEU is a variant of BLEU with a higher weight for\\nmatching entities and has higher correlation with human judgment for question generation than\\nstandard metrics. We also perform two human evaluations, one to assess generation factuality, and\\none for specificity. We define factuality as whether a statement can be corroborated by trusted external'}\n",
      "{'indexid': 18, 'id': '1', 'url': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11401', 'text': 'sources, and specificity as high mutual dependence between the input and output [33]. We follow\\nbest practice and use pairwise comparative evaluation [34]. Evaluators are shown an answer and two\\ngenerated questions, one from BART and one from RAG. They are then asked to pick one of four\\noptions‚Äîquuestion A is better, question B is better, both are good, or neither is good.\\n\\n3.4 Fact Verification\\n\\nFEVER [56] requires classifying whether a natural language claim is supported or refuted by\\nWikipedia, or whether there is not enough information to decide. The task requires retrieving\\nevidence from Wikipedia relating to the claim and then reasoning over this evidence to classify\\nwhether the claim is true, false, or unverifiable from Wikipedia alone. FEVER is a retrieval problem\\ncoupled with an challenging entailment reasoning task. It also provides an appropriate testbed for\\nexploring the RAG models‚Äô ability to handle classification rather than generation. We map FEVER\\nclass labels (supports, refutes, or not enough info) to single output tokens and directly train with\\nclaim-class pairs. Crucially, unlike most other approaches to FEVER, we do not use supervision on\\nretrieved evidence. In many real-world applications, retrieval supervision signals aren‚Äôt available, and\\nmodels that do not require such supervision will be applicable to a wider range of tasks. We explore\\ntwo variants: the standard 3-way classification task (supports/refutes/not enough info) and the 2-way\\n(supports/refutes) task studied in Thorne and Vlachos [57].

Unlike REALM and T5+SSM, RAG enjoys strong results\\nwithout expensive, specialized ‚Äúsalient span masking‚Äù pre-training [20].
