        "# How RAG with txtai works\n",
        "\n",
        "[txtai](https://github.com/neuml/txtai) is an all-in-one embeddings database for semantic search, LLM orchestration and language model workflows.\n",
        "\n",
        "Large Language Models (LLMs) have captured the public's attention with their impressive capabilities. The Generative AI era has reached a fever pitch with some predicting the coming rise of superintelligence.\n",
        "\n",
        "LLMs are far from perfect though and we're still a ways away from true AI. The biggest challenge is with hallucinations. Hallucinations is the term for when a LLM generates output that is factually incorrect. The alarming part of this is that on a cursory glance, it actually sounds like factual content. The default behavior of LLMs is to produce plausible answers even when no plausible answer exists. LLMs are not great at saying I don't know.\n",
        "\n",
        "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) helps reduce the risk of hallucinations by limiting the context in which a LLM can generate answers. This is typically done with a search query that hydrates a prompt with a relevant context. RAG has been one of the most practical use cases of the Generative AI era.\n",
        "\n",
        "txtai has a multiple ways to run RAG pipelines as follows.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Embeddings instance and LLM. Run the embeddings search and plug the search results into a LLM prompt.\n",
        "- RAG (aka Extractor) pipeline which automatically adds a search context to LLM prompts.\n",
        "- RAG FastAPI service with YAML\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook will cover all these methods and shows how RAG with txtai works."
