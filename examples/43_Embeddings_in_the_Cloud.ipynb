        "Embeddings is the engine that delivers semantic search. Data is transformed into embeddings vectors where similar concepts will produce similar vectors. Indexes both large and small are built with these vectors. The indexes are used to find results that have the same meaning, not necessarily the same keywords. \n",

        "In addition to local storage, embeddings can be synced with cloud storage. Given that txtai is a fully encapsulated index format, cloud sync is simply a matter of moving a group of files to and from cloud storage. This can be object storage such as AWS S3/Azure Blob/Google Cloud or the [Hugging Face Hub](https://hf.co/models). More details on available options can be found in the [documentation](https://neuml.github.io/txtai/embeddings/configuration/cloud/). There is also an [article](https://medium.com/neuml/serverless-vector-search-with-txtai-96f6163ab972) available that covers how to build and store indexes in cloud object storage.\n",

From the accession of Caesar Augustus as the first Roman emperor to the military anarchy of the 3rd century, it was a Principate with Italia as the metropole of its provinces and the city of Rome as its sole capital. The Empire was later ruled by multiple emperors who shared control over the Western Roman Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire. The city of Rome remained the nominal capital of both parts until AD 476 when the imperial insignia were sent to Constantinople following the capture of the Western capital of Ravenna by the Germanic barbarians. The adoption of Christianity as the state church of the Roman Empire in AD 380 and the fall of the Western Roman Empire to Germanic kings conventionally marks the end of classical antiquity and the beginning of the Middle Ages. Because of these events, along with the gradual Hellenization of the Eastern Roman Empire, historians distinguish the medieval Roman Empire that remained in the Eastern provinces as the Byzantine Empire.\",\n",
